# matiere directory - react version

## Introduction

The main goal of this work is to create a React App, and to fetch data from an API to provide content to the app. The website's back-end is fully hosted with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), and the content of the website is loaded via the Airtable API.

## Security

To avoid public release, Airtable API key is handled with dotenv (included in react-scripts).

## Live version

An online version of this app is [available here](https://annuaire-reemploi.netlify.app/).
